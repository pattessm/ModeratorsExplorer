# Background

* This project was downloaded from a tutorial here: https://www.raywenderlich.com/187041/uitableview-infinite-scrolling-tutorial

* The app allows you to search moderators from a StackExchange website you search for (e.g "stackoverflow" or "serverfault") and displays that list.

# Coding Exercise

1. Fork https://github.com/rob5408/ModeratorsExplorer
1. Add Carthage to your project
1. Pull the search functionality into your own Cart
    * This means the network and related data objects, there should be no UI elements in the Cart.
1. Link your project to that Cart
